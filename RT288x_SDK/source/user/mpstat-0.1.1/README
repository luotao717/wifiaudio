This is the README file I have created that tell how to set up mpstat for an smp
linux machine, and what is needed to run the ALPHA version of mpstat for Linux.


System Requirements:
	1) Linux 2.2.9 or later. Earlier version may need a patch (?) 
	to show per cpu maj an min faults
   
	2) The /proc directory MUST exist

	3) It is designed for SMP kernels, but may work with non SMP machines.

	4) if kernel version is less thant 2.2.9 check for tsk->processor in 
	/usr/src/linux-2.2.9/fs/proc/array.c

Howto:
	1) For 2.2 SMP kernel type make then make intsall.
	If all goes well mpstat will be intsalled in /usr/bin.

	2) For 2.4 kernel type make linux24 and then make install.

	3) For 2.2.x non SMP kernels type make nosmp, then make install.
	
	4) For 2.4 non SMP kernels type make nosmp24, then make install.

	If all goes well then you simple run mpstat like so

	mpstat

	or
		
	mpstat 5 

	(where 5 is the number of seconds that you want it to display output 
	for).

Known Bugs:

	None yet.

Done:
	1) displays the cpu id for smp kernels
	2) displays major and minor faults per cpu.
	3) displays %user,%system, and %idle times.
	4) displays interrupts per CPU
	5) displays context switches.

Todo:
	Currently not all data is split between the cpus

	to get the following info from the kernel:

	1) involuntary context switches 
	2) thread migrations - I don't see this one happening as Linux
	   treats threads as processes.
	3) spins on mutexes (mutual exclusion locks )
	4) reader/writer locks not aquired on first try 
	5) system calls
	6) percent wait time (or nice?)
	7) context switches per cpu

IF YOU CAN SUPPLY ME WITH ANY INFO ON ANY OF THESE AND HOW TO OBTAIN THIS INFO
PLEASE EMAIL ME AND TELL ME HOW.
